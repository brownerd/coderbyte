# CoderByte starter

Run CoderByte challenges locally with gulp and budo

## Setup
- Clone this repo
- Install dependencies `npm i`
- Fire up the first challenge from the commandline `gulp --d easy --c 1`. `--d` stands for difficulty. You can choose from easy, medium and hard. `--c` stands for challenge. Just indicate the number of the challenge you want to work on.
- This will open Google Chrome and live relaod your changes on save
- Open Chrome dev tools to view output in the console


## Backstory

CoderByte is rad, but it sucks if you suck at JS like I do. I don't need to be timed yet, it takes me days to figure this stuff out.

Furthermore, I wanted to try out other solutions, make notes and use Google Dev Tools easily. Also, I wanted to be able to see all of the challenges quickly. So, I copied all of the Easy challenges to this Repo. I will get around to the Medium and Hard challenges later.

I am slowly working my way through the Easy Challenges in the `in-progress` branch.
